Project Overview:
    This project performs customer segmentation for a credit card company using the BIRCH clustering algorithm. By grouping customers based on their transaction behavior and spending patterns, the model helps identify distinct customer segments for targeted marketing, personalized offers, and risk management.

Key Features:

Data preprocessing and feature scaling.
Exploratory data analysis.
Clustering using BIRCH (Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies).
Insights into customer behavior for business strategy.

Tech Stack / Libraries:

Python, Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn (BIRCH, metrics)
Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization.

Outcome:

	Cluster 0 Low Engagement Customers – occasional users with minimal transactions.
	Cluster 1: High spender Premium User with high purchase amounts and installment payments.
	Cluster 2: Cash Advance Dependent Customers – regular users with balanced usage.

Identification of meaningful customer segments.
Helps business teams design personalized strategies.
Demonstrates the effectiveness of unsupervised learning in financial datasets.
